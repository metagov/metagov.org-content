  description: |
    The **Metagovernance Project** is an interdisciplinary research collective. Metagov’s mission is to describe, support, and expand self-governance on the internet. As part of our mission, we work towards exploring research, standards, and tools that can help make self-governance more feasible for those who wish to take it on. We value *openness and inclusiveness*, *rigor and ethics in research*, and *everything as an experiment*.

    At the heart of Metagov is projects. Projects include software or research developed by members of Metagov and are conducted by both formal and informal working groups. The following tables provide and overview of current projects being incubated in Metagov.
    
    Formal working groups are groups that are supported by Metagov in the form of publication on the Metagov website, use of Metagov’s legal and financial infrastructure, and additional opportunities for cross working group coordination.
    
    Discussions and meetings for all projects conducted by formal working groups are open to the community and clearly signposted in the relevant community discussion forums. Community members are encouraged to join these meetings as observers. Community members will be given an opportunity to introduce themselves at the beginning of a meeting. This can be a good opportunity to express any interest you may have in participating or contributing to a project.
