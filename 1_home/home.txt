    metagovernance, or the governance of
    many worlds
  description: |
    The **Metagovernance Project** (Metagov) is an interdisciplinary research collective. As a vibrant community, our mission is to describe, support, and expand self-governance on the internet. We produce research outputs (academic papers), develop standards to increase technical interoperability, develop infrastructure and software products that help streamline the processes of governance, and maintain a global network of collaborators across industry, academia, and civil society.
    
    Online governance is evolving. The widespread failures of accountability among large tech companies have spurred the rise of communities that seek to distribute power and control more widely, from user-controlled social media networks to cooperatively-owned gig platforms. The vision of Metagov is to support this governance layer for the internet with an open and interoperable ecosystem of tools and resources through which communities and organizations can organize and govern themselves.
